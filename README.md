# Cpp-Algorithms
C++/Cpp algorithm codes.<br/><br>
<b>Note for viewers:</b><br>
1. If the algorithm you are searching for is not there, write the algorithm you want in the <i>Requests.txt<i> file in the next line.<br><br>
<b>Note for contributors:</b><br>
1. Use comments in your codes for viewers to understand properly.<br>
2. Properly space your codes and change lines.<br>
3. Check out the <i>Request.txt<i> file for requested algorithms.<br>
4. If you are writing a code for some specific task which have various algorithms, then create a seperate folder for it.<br>
for example - If you are adding a sorting algorithm and there is no previous folder created for sorting algorithms, then create a new folder with name Sorting Algorithms and add your code file there.<br>
